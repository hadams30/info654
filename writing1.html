            A person (about 29 years old, about 155 pounds, definitely taller than 5’3”) rides their horse down the center of 5th Avenue from 86th Street to Washington Square Park, galloping through the arch at the end of the route. Cars move politely out of their way and no one honks; no one (not even the tourists) seem to notice. 
            <br><br>
            Excitedly, the person tells their fellow equestrians about the good news. Their closest friend (taller, skinnier, younger) joins them on the same ride the following day. This time, drivers yell obscenities and harshly point out, in as many ways as possible, that this is not a road for horses. Tourists take photos and videos, bringing out mobile devices and camcorders and professional cameras to capture the moment. The equestrians continue their ride, ending at Washington Square Park again, confronted by law enforcers. 
            <br><br>
            The first rider remarks to the second: “Perhaps only an odd number of riders will go unnoticed.” 
            The second rider replies: “Is one an odd number or an even?”
            <br><br>
            The very next day, a third equestrian (34 years of age, 162 pounds, height unknown) joins the group, and they make their journey down 5th Avenue. Tourists, motorists, and law enforcers pay even more attention to them than the day before. Under the arch in the park, they consider why this could be happening, when the first rider’s initial journey was so dreamy.
            <br><br>
            The first rider remarks to the third: “Do you think it matters that we began our journey five minutes later than I did the first time?”
            The third rider replies: “I think it matters more that I forgot my helmet.”
            <br><br>
            For the next nine days, equestrians continue to join the group. They refine their process and narrow the variables, synchronizing their watches and speeds, noting the differences in public response each day. Every day, the crowds become more agitated. Local residents gather on street corners to watch the parade of horses and riders that has quickly become a daily occurrence. Law enforcers attempt, in every way they can, to prevent the group from riding. Now, only the newest additions to the group of riders find any joy or exhilaration in the ride.
            <br><br>
            When thirteen riders ride, on the thirteenth day of this trial, motorists quietly make way for the equestrians. The residents seem not to take notice of the herd. Lights turn green for the riders’ ease of passage. No tourist looks their way.
            <br><br>
            As the riders near the end of their route at Washington Square Park, the first rider makes eye contact with one person, standing on the corner of 22nd Street and 5th Avenue. This voyeur, the only one to see them ride through the city on this day, smiles and waves at the first rider. While the rest of the riders continue downtown, the first rider stops at this corner, dismounts, and begins to ask the voyeur a series of questions:
            <br><br>
            “Why is it that I often hear people walking behind me, but when I turn, no one is there? How can I balance a search for truth with a belief in other people? Does it matter if I think something happened in the past, if it isn’t happening anymore? Why is my search for self obstructed by my search for self? When will I know the right time to bring up my deepest hopes and dreams? What if I spoil others’ perception by showing myself? Does my cat know that I love him or is it a projection of self? Do my loved ones know I love them or is it a projection of self? If I think someone is watching me, does it matter whether or not they actually are? Or does it matter more that they make me feel that way? Am I in the wrong for expecting things to stay how they once were? Is there any objectivity that I can cling to, or is the idea of objectivity inherently wrong? Should I get off of my high horse, or get back on the horse, or both?”
            <br><br>
            Without an air of surprise or offense, the voyeur replies sweetly, smiling again: “I don’t know about all that, I just think your bolo tie looks nice with that shirt.”
