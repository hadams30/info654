        Slow jazz pours from mouth to air as we catch stars behind closed lids;<br>
        changing through and for nothing but selves reformed and held in <br>
        your hands I see possibility for together, else, <br>
        show me the path back to farm stands,<br>
        echoed laughter,<br>
        dependability and routine (if only for now)<br>
        looping through patterns weâ€™ve fallen into with ease<br>
        secrets whispered for us and the<br>
        red-winged blackbirds you hold gently as they feed, <br>
        projections of dreams echo your style in my mind and<br>
        I have peace knowing that for a moment we could pretend to belong to each other <br>
